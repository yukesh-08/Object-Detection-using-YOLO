# **Object-Detection-using-YOLO**

## *Project Information*

### **1. Introduction**

Object detection is a critical component of AI applications, allowing machines to recognize and track objects in real-world environments. This project employs YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, for fast and accurate object recognition. The POCO dataset is used for training, improving model precision on specific objects.

### **2. Objectives**

Implement real-time object detection using YOLOv8.
Train the model using the POCO dataset for enhanced accuracy.
Display bounding boxes around detected objects.
Provide a high-speed, low-latency detection system using a webcam.
Enable customization for different datasets and real-world applications.

### **3. Technologies Used**

**Programming Language:** Python
**Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
**Object Detection Model:** YOLOv8
**Dataset:** POCO Dataset
